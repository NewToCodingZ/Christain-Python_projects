#REPORT
#I Was given the task to investigate data relating to Heart Disease, Thalach, and Chest Pain
#types. First I loaded the data, and compair the absence and presence of Heart DIsease
#and their thalach numbers in a boxplot. I then also compair their Age compair the absence and presence 
#of Heart Disease, along with their cholrestal and Heart Desease. The Hosbitial 
#Asked to compair typical angina, asymtomatic, non-anginal pain, and atypical angina chest 
#pain types along with their thalach numbers. I then created a chart showing if heart disease
#and their chest pain.
